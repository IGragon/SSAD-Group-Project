# Accident Detection System

To overcome this issue, we have come up with this 
accident detection system which will help the victims
get rescued well in time and reduce the risk of death
caused by road accidents.

The system includes a sensor, sound meter, GPS and GSM module. 
The sensors detects the accident & sound meters will trigger
an alarm. The GPS will track the location coordinates and the GSM
will send an alert notification to the nearby hospital & police
authorities. Thus, this system will send an instant alert to the nearby
rescue team & hospital facility to notify them of the accident occurred
for them to take immediate actions.
 
This Application aids in having a better coordination and keeps all
the concerned bodies and authorities informed and alerts them quickly
which also saves time in rescuing an accident patient. When a person
meets an accident, he is usually not in a condition to interact with
an application on his phone and ask for help.

In such situation Accident is detected automatically in user app based
on sound reading and sensor reading, user app continuously senses for such
accidents. App then quickly assigns and sends notification to the nearby
Ambulance, nearby hospital and also the police informing in case of an accident
detected. Ambulance then keep updating of the status of patient whether dropped
to the hospital. Hospital can also update status if admitted to the hospital
from their app. This helps in keeping the assigned hospital prepared and informed.
Also, the User details are shared with hospital and police which helps
hospital to see the medical records of the patient and police gets to see
required details of the user in an accident.
